  Use this skill to create, edit, and validate BPMN 2.0 process diagrams for Camunda 8 (Zeebe).

  Use for: new BPMN processes, modifying existing diagrams, adding tasks/gateways/events/subprocesses, configuring Zeebe extensions (taskDefinition, ioMapping, loop characteristics), validating BPMN XML.

  Do not use for: writing FEEL expressions inside BPMN (use camunda-feel), designing form schemas (use camunda-forms), or deploying and running processes (use camunda-process-mgmt).

  **Workflow skill** — multi-step BPMN authoring. Covers c8ctl bpmn lint for validation.

# Camunda BPMN Modeling

Create and edit executable BPMN 2.0 processes for Camunda 8.8+. Generates valid XML with Zeebe extensions and diagram coordinates.

## Prerequisites

- Camunda 8.8+ cluster (local via c8run, SaaS, or Self-Managed)
- c8ctl CLI installed and configured (`c8ctl add profile`) — provides `c8ctl bpmn lint`
- **c8ctl ≥ 3.2.0** for `bpmn format`. If the command is unavailable, ask the user to upgrade: `npm install -g @camunda8/cli`

## Cross-References

- **camunda-feel**: Use for FEEL expressions in gateway conditions, input/output mappings, timer definitions
- **camunda-dmn**: Use for authoring the DMN decision behind a business rule task — `<zeebe:calledDecision decisionId="..." resultVariable="..."/>`
- **camunda-forms**: Use for creating Camunda Form JSON schemas linked to user tasks
- **camunda-connectors**: Use for configuring pre-built connectors (REST, Slack, Kafka, etc.) via element templates
- **camunda-development**: Use to decide whether a service task should be backed by an OOTB connector, a custom connector, or a job worker
- **camunda-job-workers**: Use to implement the handler code that a service task's `zeebe:taskDefinition type` activates
- **camunda-connectors-development**: Use to build a custom connector (JSON-only template or Java SDK) that attaches to a service task or event element
- **camunda-process-test**: Use for testing processes against an embedded Zeebe engine
- **camunda-process-mgmt**: Use for deploying to a cluster and running instances
- **camunda-ai-agents**: Use when modeling an AI agent — ad-hoc subprocess hosting tools driven by the AI Agent connector

## Instructions

### XML Structure

When writing a BPMN file from scratch, follow the canonical bpmn-js style — single-line `<bpmn:definitions>`, two-space indent, no blank lines between siblings, `<el />` self-closing form. Otherwise any round-trip through Camunda Modeler, Web Modeler, or `c8ctl element-template apply` reformats the file, breaking `Edit` matches and adding diff noise. Rules and a worked skeleton: [references/canonical-style.md](references/canonical-style.md).

The `zeebe` namespace, `isExecutable="true"`, and `modeler:executionPlatform="Camunda Cloud"` are mandatory — without them, Camunda won't recognize the process correctly.

The `<bpmndi:BPMNDiagram>` block is also mandatory, not optional polish: `c8ctl bpmn lint` flags missing DI (`no-bpmndi`) as an error, and Modeler can't render a process without it. Every `<bpmn:process>` flow element needs a matching `<bpmndi:BPMNShape>`, every `<bpmn:sequenceFlow>` a `<bpmndi:BPMNEdge>`. Coordinates, sizes, and waypoint conventions: [references/layout-rules.md](references/layout-rules.md). Note that Zeebe deploys a DI-less BPMN happily — the missing DI surfaces only at lint and in Modeler, so don't rely on a successful deploy as evidence the file is well-formed.

### Symbol Encoding

Always encode special characters in XML attribute values:
- `<` → `&lt;`, `>` → `&gt;`, `&` → `&amp;`, `"` → `&quot;`, `'` → `&apos;`

### Core Modeling Rules

**Start/End Events:**
- Every path starts with a Start Event (no incoming flows) and reaches an End Event (no outgoing flows)
- Use None start event for most processes; Message for external triggers; Timer for scheduled execution

**Tasks** — one atomic action per task:
- **User Task**: Human interaction. Use the Camunda user task implementation: include `<zeebe:userTask />` and link the form via `<zeebe:formDefinition formId="X" />`. Assign with `<zeebe:assignmentDefinition candidateGroups="..." />`. Setting `formId="X"` makes `X.form` a required deliverable — author it via **camunda-forms** in the same step, or flag the gap explicitly in your final message. `c8ctl bpmn lint` checks the attribute is present, not that the file resolves. Do NOT write the deprecated job-worker variant (no `<zeebe:userTask />`, `formKey` instead of `formId`) — see [references/zeebe-extensions.md](references/zeebe-extensions.md) § Form Definition.
- **Service Task**: Automated work. Requires `<zeebe:taskDefinition type="..." retries="3" />`. The type must exactly match worker registration (case-sensitive). When backed by an out-of-the-box connector, apply the template via **camunda-connectors** — don't hand-write the connector input mappings.
- **Script Task**: Inline FEEL expression. Uses `<zeebe:script expression="=..." resultVariable="..." />`.
- **Business Rule Task**: DMN evaluation. Uses `<zeebe:calledDecision decisionId="X" resultVariable="..." />`. `decisionId="X"` makes the corresponding `X.dmn` a required deliverable — author it via **camunda-dmn**.
- Name tasks with **verb + object** pattern: "Review invoice", "Send notification"

**Gateways:**
- **Exclusive (XOR)**: Exactly one path taken. Set `default` attribute for the fallback flow. Label condition flows.
- **Parallel (AND)**: All paths taken concurrently. Always use a matching join gateway to synchronize.
- **Inclusive (OR)**: One or more paths. Also requires a matching join.
- Fix fake-join warnings from `c8ctl bpmn lint` — join gateways must match their fork type.

**Sequence Flows:**
- Conditions use FEEL expressions with `=` prefix:
  ```xml
  <bpmn:conditionExpression xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression">=amount &gt; 1000</bpmn:conditionExpression>
  ```

**FEEL Expressions in BPMN** — all FEEL must be prefixed with `=`:
- Gateway conditions: `=riskLevel = "HIGH"`
- Timer durations: `="PT7D"` (plain `PT7D` is rejected)
- Input/output mappings: `=customer.name`

Anything beyond a simple variable reference (function calls, operators, context literals, `for` / `every` / `some`) — validate via **camunda-feel** before committing.

**IDs**: Use descriptive PascalCase — `ReviewInvoice`, `AmountExceedsLimit`, `Flow_ToApproval`

### Input/Output Mappings

Create local variables and control variable propagation:

```xml
<zeebe:ioMapping>
  <!-- Input: create local variable from parent scope -->
  <zeebe:input source="=customer.name" target="customerName" />
  <!-- Output: propagate local result to parent scope -->
  <zeebe:output source="=result.status" target="paymentStatus" />
</zeebe:ioMapping>
```

See [references/zeebe-extensions.md](references/zeebe-extensions.md) for detailed variable scoping, propagation rules, and examples.

### Working with Existing BPMN Files

BPMN files can be large. Follow these rules:
1. **Use Grep to find elements** — never read entire files unnecessarily
2. **Use Edit for modifications** — locate the exact section with Grep first, then make precise edits
3. **Read specific sections only** — use offset/limit when needed

### Hygiene

- Follow canonical bpmn-js style — see [references/canonical-style.md](references/canonical-style.md)
- Self-close empty elements with `<el />` (single space before `/>`)
- Keep unique, descriptive IDs
- Include BPMN DI section for visual layout (see [references/layout-rules.md](references/layout-rules.md))
- Include `<bpmn:incoming>` and `<bpmn:outgoing>` flow references on elements

### Lint loop — structural exit gate

A BPMN edit is **not structurally done** until `c8ctl bpmn lint` reports zero errors AND zero warnings. Treat this as the closing structural step of every BPMN task — generation, modification, refactor, or merge.

1. Run the linter against the file you touched:

   ```bash
   c8ctl bpmn lint path/to/process.bpmn
   ```

   `c8ctl bpmn lint` auto-detects the Camunda execution platform version from the BPMN file and applies sensible Camunda defaults. If a `.bpmnlintrc` is present in the project, it is used instead. Stdin also works: `cat process.bpmn | c8ctl bpmn lint`.

2. If output is non-empty, fix every reported issue and run the linter again. Common categories:
   - **no-overlapping-elements** — adjust DI coordinates per [references/layout-rules.md](references/layout-rules.md) spacing rules
   - **fake-join** — make join gateways match their fork type (XOR forks → XOR joins, AND forks → AND joins)
   - **label-required** — name every labeled element
   - **no-disconnected** — ensure every element is on a complete start-to-end path
   - **no-implicit-split** — exclusive gateway outgoing flows need conditions + a default
   - **superfluous-gateway** — drop pass-through gateways with one in, one out

3. Loop until the linter is clean. Do not declare the task structurally done while warnings remain — silently-failing BPMN deploys to the cluster and surfaces as runtime incidents.

If a warning is genuinely a false positive, suppress it explicitly in a project-level `.bpmnlintrc` and flag the suppression in your final message — never silently ignore.

### Batch linting and fix guidance

When the task targets a directory (not a single file), use the directory workflow in [references/bpmn-lint.md](references/bpmn-lint.md): discover BPMN files recursively (with skip directories), lint each file, apply targeted fixes, then re-lint until clean.

### Behavioural validation

Lint catches structure, not runtime behaviour (FEEL errors, missing workers, unreachable end events). After lint is clean, validate by **running the process**: prefer **camunda-process-test** for embedded-engine feedback without a cluster, or fall back to **camunda-process-mgmt** to deploy and run an instance.

### Runtime compatibility gate

Before a BPMN change moves to deployment/testing, run a compatibility pass with `c8ctl bpmn lint` against the exact files you intend to deploy (single file or full directory set). This is a required runtime-compatibility check, but it is not by itself a deployment-success guarantee.

Use this troubleshooting mapping when lint flags compatibility issues:

- **implementation/task-definition** failures: task missing required Zeebe extension (`<zeebe:taskDefinition>`, `<zeebe:calledDecision>`, etc.) for its BPMN type.
- **feel / io-mapping** failures: expressions are not valid FEEL for Camunda 8 (for example legacy `${...}` or non-FEEL mapping syntax). Cross-check with **camunda-feel**.
- **element-type / gateway** failures: model uses unsupported or discouraged constructs for the target runtime profile.
- **timer / event-definition** failures: timer or event configuration is structurally present but invalid for runtime execution.

For a full compatibility workflow (target selection, directory runs, and fix loop), use [references/runtime-compatibility.md](references/runtime-compatibility.md).
